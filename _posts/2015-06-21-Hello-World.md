title: Hello World!

Hi and welcome to my blog! 
I’m Plunder, a female computer science student.

I started this blog for different reasons:

1. As a woman in the IT environment the first question I get asked is: „Oh wow you are a computer scientist?! How did you as a girl get there?“. Most of the time the comment „I’m surprised because you don’t look like a IT nerd at all“ is just following that question.
So I want to use this opportunity to show how you can start your life as a woman in the computer science world and also to motivate other women and men to get more in touch with IT not only by using some IT products but also by understanding what goes on behind the scenes.

2. I definitely want to get rid of that image that people have in their minds where computer scientists are weird nerds hiding in dark chambers behind their pcs doing freaky stuff that nobody else would understand. In many points I’m totally a nerd but Hey! I’m super proud of it since at the same time it means that I’m starting to get better in what I’m doing. Every successful person is a nerd in his or her area of interest. But that doesn’t mean that a nerd must be a weird, ugly, boring outsider.

3. There is a app called „Happening“ where you can play Ranking games with your friends. Everybody get questions like „Who believed in Santa Clause the longest?“,  „Who is the smartest“ or „Who is propably an alien“ (I got the first position in that one haha) and then you rank your friends by defining the first three positions in the ranking. Afterwards you are supposed to predict your own position. The better your prediction is the more points you get for each round. I’m telling you this because a few days ago there was the question „Who has the most outspoken opinion“ and I got the overall majority to be on the first position of the ranking. I was quite surprised and asked my friends why they voted like that. They were laughing being like „Haha you are seriously asking that? That was super clear since you are always talking about what you are thinking and you want us to listen to it“. So instead of just bordering my friends with my thoughts and opinions I decided to share them also with everyone in the internet :D I mean you’re quite lucky! Unlike my fiends you don’t have to listen or in this case read my jabbering ;)
