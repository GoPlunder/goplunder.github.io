Hi!

After my blog post yesterday I tried out soya milk in my [Caro Coffee] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caro_%28beverage%29) and honestly…I didn’t like it at all. 
First it felt weird because the color of the milk is a bit darker and the milk doesn’t smell good. And the coffee doesn’t really get brighter when during the soya milk in it. That wouldn’t be a problem at all but the taste is so odd that you can’t ignore it. I don’t know if that’s possible but it kind of tasted like beans. But perhaps I just persuaded myself of that because I know that it is made of soya beans.
Nevertheless I think I will try out rice milk and oat milk and if both don’t work out for me I will have to stay with the organic milk :)

But that’s not all. Today we went to a Burger restaurant and it was the first time in my life that I ordered a veggie burger instead of a normal burger with (really tasty) meat.
And I was super surprised because it tasted so damn good :D
So since yesterday I’m meat free and I know that that’s not much yet but still. I will definitely try to keep it like that.
Since I can’t control where the meat in restaurants is coming from I’m just going to eat meat when I know it is organic. So in the end I will have to buy and cook the meat by myself.

I will keep you updated.
