title: First Blog Post (thanks to Jekyll Now)

Hi!

My name is Plunder and a few days ago I was in the mood of starting my own blog…soooo here I am.
Since I wanted to keep it as simple as possible (for the beginning) I used the awesome project [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). 
![First Blog Post]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-screenshot.png "an image title")
Thanks to it I could start within a few minutes a static site blog which is GitHub hosted.
The next step is to learn how to use markdown (which I am already doing by writing this post…but ok).
My goal for this blog is to learn new stuff by testing and writing about it. And since I am a woman studying computer science I will also write about my experience as a female student in the IT world.

Good night World Wide Web!
