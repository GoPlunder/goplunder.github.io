title: Vegan Lifestyle?
---

Hi!

In my first blog post a few weeks ago I said that I will write about stuff that I tested. In the last month I watched two documentations about large-scale animal husbandry. Every time when I see how bad we treat animals and how unthoughtful we are regarding the food we eat I am shocked.
Since I am young (22 years old) and still quite flexible (I don’t have to work the hole week and I don’t have a husband or kids) I thought I should try to change my lifestyle.
I want to try to eat more sensible and to find out where my food  but also my clothes, my cosmetics and other stuff is coming from.
My first attempts are to reduce my meat consumption to 2 times a week and to buy only organic animal products. So it’s not a vegan lifestyle but perhaps I will reach that step by step.
Let’s see how this will work out for me.
